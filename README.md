# Huffman
Encode and decode a text using the Huffman algorithm.

## Deployment
It is not allowed to use containers, algorithms, functions and iterators from STL. For solving the problem you had to implement your own data structures which accommodate the real data structures (the priority queue should act like a priority queue - it respects the FIFO principle and, also, an order amongs elements from queue is kept).
